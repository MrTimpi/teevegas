# Make Vegas great again!
TeeVegas is a set of scripts and tools to make Vegas Pro more usable for sound designers. The overall goal is to make Vegas asset-centric, turning it into a solution for creating and manipulating individual sound files, and also to assist in performing tasks that are commonplace in sound design.

## Features
RegionRender — A flexible batch rendering solution with full recall
MetaMarkers — Quickly select and randomize takes and variations within samples
Search / replace, re-arrange and audition regions before rendering
Media management — Collate, re-target and create new versions of your source assets
Currently, TeeVegas is offered as a standalone package, meaning you’ll have to do some gentle hood-popping to get it up and running in Vegas.

__TeeVegas is offered as-is, free of charge, with limited support.
